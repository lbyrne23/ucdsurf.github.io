		<h1> Intermediates </h1>
		<p> Already know how to catch waves and can't stand the thought of sitting through another lesson? We have a core group of intermediate surfers within the club. On trips, you'll head out with one of our club lifeguards to catch some waves more independently. This year we will have a huge range of boards avaliable to rent on campus too if you want to progress from foamies! Stay tuned for more info. </p>

		<h1> Advanced </h1>
		<p> Our advanced surfers head west whenever there's good conditions. If you're already confident catching waves and own a board, join our advance members group! We compete in Intervarsities every March and have competitors of all experience levels. For those of you with no equipment, stay tuned for more info about our rental system.</p>
