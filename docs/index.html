		<h1> Who Are We? </h1>
		<p> We are Ireland’s largest surf club that consists of mostly beginners, as well as experienced surfers. We come together to celebrate the sport of surfing and the warm and fun culture that surfing promotes. The objective of the club is to get our members surfing as much as possible through a friendly and safe environment. We organise numerous trips to the west coast of Ireland as well as trips abroad.
			We also highlight the importance of water safety and offer our members the opportunity to complete the NBLQ Beach Lifeguard course. We allow beginners and experienced surfers to compete in the Surf Intervarsity Championship and Colours. We show our members that surfing is a fun, challenging sport and a great way to meet new people.</p>
