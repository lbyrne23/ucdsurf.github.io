	<h1> Join us on the Wild Atlantic Way </h1>
	<h2>BUNDORAN - September 29th</h2>
<p>This is our first trip of the year with over 70 people. For many this is the first adventure where surf club steals their heart and never gives it back. This trip includes massive 12 bed houses beside the sea, lessons with Turn'N'Surf, and a traditional Black Tie night to the exclusive Paris nightclub. We revisit Bundoran on our daytrips, and again for our first trip of semester 2.</p>
   
<h2>ENNISCRONE - October 27th</h2>
<p>Our legendary three night Halloween surf trip. In the quaint and beautiful town of Enniscrone you will be placed in a warm and comfortable 8-person house and given three days to run around, surf some of the best waves in Ireland, and dress up as terrifyingly or creatively as you can for our Halloween Surf Party. The houses are walking distance to the beach and surf school, there’s plenty of shops and pubs to explore, and we even throw in a massive gum-ball challenge where every house will duke it out for surf club glory.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN TRIP - March 2018</h2>
<p>UCD Surf Club was the first surf club in Ireland to organize a large scale college trip to Morocco. Each year has been more and more of a success. Surf Club works hard in organizing our foreign trip so that our members can become immersed in a foreign culture, experience breathtaking settings, and surf some of the best waves in the world. This year for our second semester trip we are taking a break from Morocco to allow our members to experience the waves of Portugal.</p>

<h2>DUNFANAGHY - May 2018</h2>
<p>Last year was UCD Surf’s first time in the quiet and peaceful town of Dunfanaghy. It was love at first sight. The town is a brilliant location for small surf trips with it’s incredibly developed and advanced Narosa Surf School, amazing hikes through local forests, mountains, and Glenveagh National Park; as well as some of the most comfortable and beautiful houses UCD Surf has ever stayed in. A perfect recipe for a fun and memorable surf trip.</p>
