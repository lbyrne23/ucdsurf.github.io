<h2>BUNDORAN</h2>
<h3> September 28th - 30th 2018 </h3>
<p>This is our first trip of the year with over 70 people. For many this is the first adventure where surf club steals their heart and never gives it back. This trip includes massive 12 bed houses beside the sea, lessons with Turn'N'Surf, and a traditional Black Tie night to the exclusive Paris nightclub. We revisit Bundoran on our daytrips.</p>

You will be given three days to run around, surf some of the best waves in Ireland, and dress up as terrifyingly or creatively as you can for our Halloween Surf Party. We even throw in a massive gum-ball challenge where every house will duke it out for surf club glory.</p>
