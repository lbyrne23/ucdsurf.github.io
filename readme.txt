I chose "Option 2: Design a promotional website targeted at an audience interested in joining a
club/group in view of improving their personal fitness and/or well-being."

My website is a promotional website for UCD Surf Club.

"project.html" is the main page.

The main page is a splash screen with a slideshow of photos and links to other areas of the website.
On this page, the user can just click a link or scroll down to find out more.

When the links are hovered over, they turn a dark blue colour which matches the blue on the UCD crest.

I've included a navbar at the top of every page to make navigation around the site simple.

As it is a promotional website, I've made the "Join Us" link stand out more than the otehr links.

The website depends heavily on visuals to communicate the feel of the club. I've used large, colourful photos on every page.

The trips page has a full screen silent looping video as the background in order to advertise the trips the club offers through visuals rather than just words.

The video (originally 4 minutes long) was cut down to a one minute clip to minimise loading time. 

As I use a lot of text on top of colourful images, I use white text with a black shadow to ease reading.

I used a font from Google fonts, News Cycle, for the entirety of this project.

I used percentages rather than pixels to size the elements to allow for resizing on different window sizes.

External links open in a new tab to enure the user stays on the website.

I've included javascript gif rollovers on the ourmembers page. This was to allow a lot of content without crowding the page.

I put an emphasis on beginners as this is targeted at those who want to join a sports club and improve their fitness rather than those who are already active.

The FAQ is in depth and ends with a mailto our email address, which allows the user to enquire more.

The form is validated to ensure the user enters a valid email address.

The website uses large, colourful, and opaque images, with slow moving slideshows. This creates a free, welcoming, lightherded atmosphere rather than an intense dark one. I feel this aesthetic is more suitable for people looking to become active and it has a more relaxed feel.

All images and videos were taken by myself and the Surf Club Public relations officer who has given me permission to use them in this project.
